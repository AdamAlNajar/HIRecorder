Thank you for downloading the screen recorder,

License and legal things:
You can use this anywhere and do whatever you want with it, just not redistribute

How to use:
1 - Select screen/Tab to record 
2 - Click on Share (it's recording button)
3 - Click on hide, when you see the menu (optional)
4 - Proceed with your actions

To download your recording just click on the 3 dots and wait for download to appear 
(you can only download the video once its done proccessing)

NOTE : Microphones cannot be recorded in this tool, thats why theres a Audio recorder tool in this page as well

(I Reccomend using this tool, you can control the audio seperately when editing youtube videos since it doesnt feature microphone support)

If you would like to Suggest a feature or register a bug, use the issues tab and submit, i will get back to you as soon as i can :)
